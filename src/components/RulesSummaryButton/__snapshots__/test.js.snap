            General: 
          </strong>
          Play using the rules from the Claustrophbia board game, unless stated otherwise here. Follow the instructions for each phase and track your progress when you complete each phase.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Setup: 
          </strong>
          Event cards, Demon cards, Threat Point tokens and the Board of Destiny are not needed, as they will be replaced by this app.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Tile Placement: 
          </strong>
          The Human player decides the orientation when placing tiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Hole in the Ground: 
          </strong>
          This tile should be treated as a
          <strong>
            Lair 
          </strong>
          tile instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Demonic Mechanism*: 
          </strong>
          This tile has changed to increase the Threat Die by 2, when placed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Oil for your lamp*: 
          </strong>
          This advantage has been modified to prevent an event card from being drawn on that turn, in addition to cancelling the effect of the
          <strong>
             Demonic Mechanism 
          </strong>
          tile.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Aura of Blessing*: 
          </strong>
          This gift has changed to reduce the Threat Die by 2.
