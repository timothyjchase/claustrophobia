        <p>
          During the Threat phase, if there is no demon in play, then a d6 is rolled. If the result exceeds the Demon Die, then a demon is added and the Demon Die is reset to 6. If the result does not, then the Demon Die is reduced by 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where the Demon is added will depend on the scenario and the situation. The scenario will limit the number of times a Demon can be added.

          During the Threat phase, if no demon has just been added, and the number of Troglodytes in play is less than the Threat Die, then Troglodytes will be added and the Threat Die is reduced by 1.

          depending on their proximity to Human warriors, further reducing the Threat Die (by 2 and 1 respectively). When the Threat Die reaches 0, it is rolled again.

              Removing Troglogytes increases the chance that the Demon AI will draw an Event during the next Threat phase.

        <p>
          The odds of drawing a card increase, the more Troglodytes that are removed and the fewer that remain (percent of drawing an Event = 1 / total number of Troglodytes before removal). For example, removing 1 Troglodye, when there are 5 remaining, results in 20% chance of drawing an Event. Removing the last Troglodyte will guarantee that an event will be drawn.
        </p>
        <p>
          A maximum of 1 Event can be drawn per turn.
        </p>

          The text of an Event may change depending on the scenario.

          Events may be cancelled with no effect, by using the upper right menu in the Event message (like when using

          ).
